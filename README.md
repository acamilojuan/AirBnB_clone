 **Output**

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

    Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

    Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…

    Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

    Update attributes of an object

    Destroy an object
